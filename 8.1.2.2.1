Challenge # 1
----------------------------------------------------
Can you explain?

What do the following mean?
1) Assignment: Uses "=" and means its assigning the value of a variable or integer. 
2) Comparison: Uses "==" and means that its being asked to compare to values if its true or false because the answer is Boolean.
3) What is the difference between "=" and "==".: One equal sign means its an assignment, 2 means its a comparison.
4) Boolean: Means that I'm asking the computer if a value is true or false.
