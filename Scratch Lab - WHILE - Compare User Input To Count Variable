Coding Challenge:
WHILE - Do Math On User Input Lab 

Use the following Pseudocode to wrtie a program:

 - Ask user for an integer number greater than 20
 - Don't forget test the <user_number> to see if it's an integer
 - Set our initial <count> variable to 0
 - While our <User_number> is greater than 1
 - Divide the <user_number> by 2
 - Increase our <count> by 1
 - end

Expected Output: If the user_number was 20:

  Starting Code Challenge
  Enter an integer number 20 or greater >20
  Your number 20 is a valid Integer 20 or greater.  Thanks
  Starting While Loop - Print Count Variable
  The user input started as  20
  The current value of the user input after some math is 10.0
  The while loop has looped 1 time
  The current value of the user input after some math is 5.0
  The while loop has looped 2 time
  The current value of the user input after some math is 2.5
  The while loop has looped 3 time
  The current value of the user input after some math is 1.25
  The while loop has looped 4 time
  The current value of the user input after some math is 0.625
  The while loop has looped 5 time
  Ending While Loop
  The While Loop, looped a total of 5 times
