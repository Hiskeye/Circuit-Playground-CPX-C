# Python WHILE - Do Math On User Input Lab - Scratch Pad
# Use this Replit to try some code... Use it as a scratch pad.

Coding Challenge:
WHILE - Compare User Input To Count Variable

# Your Code Starts Here:
try:
    number = int(input("Enter an integer number between 0 and 10: " ))
    if 0 <= number <= 10:
        print("Your number is ", number)
         # Declare Any main() Variables - (Not Global)
        print("Starting While Loop - Print Count Variable")
        print(count)
        # Enter Your Code Here:
        while count <= 9:
            count = count + 1
            print(count)
            if count == number:

                print("Your number = ", number)
                print("The count = ", count)
        print("Ending While Loop")
